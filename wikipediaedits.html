    <h1> Wikipedia Reflection </h1>
    
    <p>
While working on these Wikipedia assignments, I never realized the amount of work that went behind regulating all the information that surfaced on the internet. I knew that Wikipedia was an all- welcoming platform, where anyone could edit, so I wasn’t sure how they would regulate the internet trolls. I was expecting something like AI to pick up unusual activity from a certain user or to catch inappropriate text, but I was surprised to see that it was usually the Wikipedia community who regulated the site. I thought that users would only edit or write articles that they were interested in but based off of Professor Evalyn’s experience as a wiki editor, I was surprised to see how big and supportive everyone was in the community.

It was also surprising to see the different types of WikiProjects and how users could earn badges for how well they wrote Wikipedia articles. I didn’t expect there to be a ranking system for users, especially restricted access for those who can edit certain articles and not. Because at first I wanted to edit a famous K-pop group’s article for my Wikiedit assignment, but I realized I was blocked by Extended confirmed protection. Alongside this, I feel like there are still so many things that I don’t know about Wikipedia. Although I completed the AfD assignment, I think that there are still a lot of layers to nominating an article for deletion that I haven’t fully comprehended. Therefore, if you really want to be an avid user of Wikipedia, I feel like it is important to read the Wikipedia guidelines for what’s a good article and what’s not a good article and also what references are considered reliable sources. Personally, I
thought that medical journals were reliable sources all this time, but in a Wikiedu class, they specifically identified that any published medical journals except for systematic reviews and literature reviews were deemed as unreliable. I wouldn’t have known this if I hadn’t researched the context of reliable sources, so before you start editing always read over the guidelines.

I think that Wikipedia is well-known enough by the general public that everyone knows they could edit the articles if they wanted to. However, I was always hesitant to edit because I was afraid that something I wrote could have grammatical errors or could be misinterpreted as incorrect information and I didn’t want to be held responsible for that. But I think knowing that there is a team of Wikipedia editors who monitors the articles helps give reassurance to know that there are people who peer edits your work. Even if a lot of teachers advise against using Wikipedia as a citation, I think that Wikipedia should reach out to more teachers or people who are confident with their writing to become editors. There should be a test for editors so that if they complete it, they could help organize Wikipedia articles to be more cohesive and intellectual, as well as earning a badge to their profile.
